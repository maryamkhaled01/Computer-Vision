# Computer-Vision
Implementation of some computer vision tasks such as:
1. Image Cartoonifying: Apply image processing filters to make the real-world images look like they are from a cartoon.
2. Road Lane Detection: Detection of road lanes in an image using Hough Transform.
3. Augmented Reality: Implementing AR application using planar homographies.
4. Image Mosaics: Implementing an image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic.
5. Stereo Vision: It is a basline stereo case where the disparity is calculated by two ways, block matching and dynamic programming matching.
